### Demographic Data Analyser
**Code:** ['Data Analyser'](https://github.com/apologies28/Projects/blob/main/demographic_data_analyzer.py)

**Description:** This project focused on analysing demographic data using Pandas. A [dataset](https://github.com/apologies28/Projects/blob/main/adult.data.csv) of demographic data is given that was extracted from the 1994 Census database.

**Goal:** To use Pandas to answer the following questions: 

  - How many people of each race are represented in this dataset?
  - What is the average age of men?
  - What is the percentage of people who have a Bachelor's degree?
  - What percentage of people with advanced education (Bachelors, Masters, or Doctorate) make more than 50K?
  - What percentage of people without advanced education make more than 50K?
  - What is the minimum number of hours a person works per week?
  - What percentage of the people who work the minimum number of hours per week have a salary of more than 50K?
  - What country has the highest percentage of people that earn >50K and what is that percentage?
  - Identify the most popular occupation for those who earn >50K in India.

**Technology:** Python, Pandas, Numpy,

**Results:** 

 - **Number of each race:**
    - **White:** 27,816  
    - **Black:** 3,124  
    - **Asian-Pac-Islander:** 1,039  
    - **Amer-Indian-Eskimo:** 311  
    - **Other:** 271  
  - **Average age of men:** 39.4  
  - **Percentage with Bachelor's degrees:** 16.4%  
  - **Percentage with higher education that earn >50K:** 46.5%  
  - **Percentage without higher education that earn >50K:** 17.4%  
  - **Minimum work time:** 1 hour/week  
  - **Percentage of rich among those who work the fewest hours:** 10.0%  
  - **Country with the highest percentage of rich people:** Iran (41.9%)  
  - **Most popular occupation for those earning >50K in India:** Prof-specialty

### Mean-Variance-Standard Deviation Calculator
**Code:** ['Calculator'](https://github.com/apologies28/Projects/blob/main/mean_var_std.py)

**Description:** This task focused on creating a function that uses Numpy to output the mean, variance, standard deviation, max, min, and sum of the rows, columns, and elements in a 3 x 3 matrix along both axes and for the flattened matrix.

**Technology:** Python, Pandas, Numpy,
